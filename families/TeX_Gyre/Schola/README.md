The [TeX Gyre project][tg-project-tgs] describes Schola as:

> TeX Gyre Schola is based on the URW Century Schoolbook L kindly released by
> URW++ Design and Development Inc. under GFL (independently of the GPL release
> accompanying Ghostscript). The Vietnamese glyphs were added by Han The Thanh.
>
> TeX Gyre Schola can be used as a replacement for the Century Schoolbook
> typeface (designed by Morris Fuller Benton, 1919, for the American Type
> Founders; originally, italics were not designed, they were added in later
> revivals by Linotype and ITC).

The [Wikipedia entry on _Century Schoolbook_][century-schoolbook-wikipedia]
describes Schola as:

> A very limited set of styles digitised by URW++ has been released as
> open-source software as part of the Ghostscript project in type 1 format. TeX
> Gyre Schola is an adaptation of the URW release by a Polish group. Including
> a Cyrillic version and small caps, it is perhaps the most complete
> open-source digitisation of the Century family.
