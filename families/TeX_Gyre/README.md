# TeX Gyre

Per the [homepage][homepage], the TeX Gyre project provides:

> [...] an extensive remake and extension of the freely available 35 base
> PostScript fonts distributed with Ghostscript ver. 4.00. The important aspect
> of the project is providing not only the support for TeX but also the
> cross-platform OpenType format of the fonts.

The project includes the following font families (in alphabetical order):

* Adventor
* Bonum
* Chorus
* Cursor
* Heros
* Pagella
* [Schola](Schola)
* Termes

The font families included in this repo are linked above; all families can be
downloaded directly from the [project website][homepage]. The TeX Gyre project
also includes [math fonts][tg-math-fonts] corresponding to several of the
font families above.

## License

The TeX Gyre project states (links added for convenience) describes their
license as follows:

> The TeX Gyre fonts are licensed under the [GUST Font License
> (GFL)][gust-font-license], which is a free license, legally equivalent to the
> [LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL)][latex-license], version 1.3c or later.

Additionally, the project provides some history behind the licensing:

> One should however note that licensing of the TeX Gyre fonts under the GFL
> has become feasible only after the URW++ company allowed the distribution of
> the 35 base Postscript fonts as shipped with GhostScript 4.00 to be also
> governed by the LPPL. This happened on the 22nd June 2009, with the personal
> involvement of Dr. Peter Rosenfeld, URW++'s manging director.

as well as usage guidance and a request from the project:

> The freedoms granted by GFL include the free use of the fonts for whatever
> purpose you wish. You can also take the fonts and modify them for your own
> use or redistribution, but to avoid confusion in such a case you are
> requested to change the name(s) of the font(s) and comprising filesâ€”please
> follow the guidance of the license.
